In this project, we try to solve a traveler planning problem through a model of undirected weighted graph. It is assumed that a man plans to travel around several cities, return the original city, and only visit every city for once. There are three transportation methods that he can choose including: flight, railway, and highway. Our goal is to choose a most economical transportation method between every two cities according to different money and time cost weight. And we will calculate the shortest path for the whole trip. In other words, we can get a travelling route, which is the most efficient or economical consistent with usersâ€™ requirement.
